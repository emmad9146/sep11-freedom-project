# Entry 1

     For my freedom project, I want to create a site where people can read about their horoscope and zodiac signs, but actually learn about astrology. Most people know their sign and maybe a few traits or meanings, but they don't actaully understand the fact that there is a real science behind it; astronomia. I'm very interested in this aswell, and I know first hand that it's hard to educate yourself in it, so I want to create a tool to help and explain.
      Ideally, my project will also allow the user to put in any changes they've noticed, and tell them whether or not their is an astrological reson for it. If so, it would also be able to explain why.
